The task
Develop a solution that, given a select query, can read data from a database, write it to a local file and then delete the data from the database. The solution should verify that data is written to the file, and that data integrity is maintained, before deleting it from the database.

Use Bash, PHP, JavaScript or Go as the language
Use MySQL, MariaDB, CockroachDB or SQLite as the database
Please use the data set provided in the SQL dump in this repo. Please also consider that your solution should be able to handle much larger data sets.
